## Frequently unasked questions (FUQ for short)
**Q: When will there be native support for Wayland?**

A: Probably never because Tk won't support Wayland in the foreseeable future. I can't use Gtk or Qt because I don't want Plin to have more of a memory footprint than SuperMemo. Running Plin through Xwayland is still more resource-efficient than using those frameworks would be. Should the time ever come when Xwayland is completely deprecated (very unlikely) and Tk still doesn't support Wayland (even less likely), I guess I would have to rewrite this using SDL or something.
